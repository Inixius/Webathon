# Webathon

The following three features for the three quiz web pages are under development:

1) The table on the left side of the screen should change the colour of it's number with respective to the questions that have options selected.

2) The submit button calculates and displays an alert message with the final score. Instead, it should display the final score on the web page at the submit button.

3) The quote pictures on the right side of the screen should slide in from left to right or right to left.

There are many more features that I plan to add in the future.
